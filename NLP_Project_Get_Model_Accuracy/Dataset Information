A test dataset of syllabus of various undergrad courses at multiple universities related to the subjects Operating Systems, Discrete Maths and Data Structures & Algorithms was created and each file was labelled “Yes” or “No” indicating whether a prerequisite waiver would have been granted if a student had uploaded that file. This dataset was used for calculating the accuracy of the three text matching algorithms implemented.
