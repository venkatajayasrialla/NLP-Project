# Automated-Prerequisite-Waiver-Project

A prototype of an automated prerequisite waiver system that will determine whether one’s previous undergrad coursework is sufficient to opt out of taking corresponding prerequisite classes.

Incoming and transfer masters students at the university are given prerequisite courses based on their program, undergraduate transcripts and work experience to ensure students have a sufficient background in their prospective program. Incoming students can appeal these prerequisites based on their undergraduate coursework or work experience. To register in higher-level courses, students must first obtain a temporary waiver, then a permanent waiver, following a committee’s evaluation on a case-by-case basis. This is a lengthy process as a large number of incoming and transfer students request a prerequisite waiver. We aim to automate this process by using machine learning based text matching algorithms.
